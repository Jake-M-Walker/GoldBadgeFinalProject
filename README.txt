Gold Badge Final Project

This solution contains the Cafe, Claim and Badge challenges. All the applications have POCOs, Repositories, Unit Tests, and UI.
All were created using VS Community and pushed up to github. 

Most difficult parts of creating these applications was my unfamiliarity with Dictionaries and how they worked.

Cafe Challenge has the ability to Add, Delete, and View All meals currently offered.

Claim Challenge has the ability to Create, View All, and Take Care of next claim

Badge Challege has the ability to Create a badge, Update the Doors on a current badge, and View All Badges.
